# Render-Engine
Aim of this project is to create procedural render engine which supports raycasting, raymarching, volumetric clouds, water, terrain generation, normal mapping lighting, bloom, and a lot of other stuff. It's my sandbox to play with 3D graphics

This projects needs a major refactor so I've decided to code it again from the scratch. Main problem was that architecture did not allow to easily plug in new features.
